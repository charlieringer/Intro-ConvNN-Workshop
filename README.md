# Intro-ConvNN-Workshop
Really really simple beginner friendly project for learning about ConvNN using &lt; 40 lines

# A Dell or Adele
This network is train to classify images as either A Dell or Adele. The data set is tiny so that you can train it in seconds on a crappy machine to give you an idea about how Deep Learning with Keras works.

# Requirements
- Python 3
- Keras
- Tensorflow (installed automatically with Keras)

# Usage
Run `python Intro-ConvNN-Workshop.py` in your terminal. It will train (takes about 10-12 seconds on a MacBook Pro) and then test (takes a few seconds) and provide you with an accuracy score for how good it is at classifiying Adelle and A Dell. 

# Future
From me? nothing. From you? hopefully you will take this code, edit it, make it better and turn it in to something special.
